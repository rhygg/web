When it comes to expressive web-apps in **golang** particularly with that *django* style, nothing can surpass [beego](https://beego.me) the expressive & progressive web framework for golang.
Now I've already talked about Fiber previously & no doubt fiber is spectacular when lightweight frameworks are being talked about.
Beego is infinitely scalable if you ask me.

# Let's make an App
You'll have to install beego with 
```bash
go get github.com/beego/bee/v2
```

The ``$GOPATH/bin`` must be in your `$PATH` variable, so that the `bee` cli can work.

Start by creating a new project.

```bash
bee new test
```

here's the file structure.
```
test
â”œâ”€â”€ conf
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app.conf
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default.go
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”œâ”€â”€ models
â”œâ”€â”€ routers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ router.go
â”œâ”€â”€ static
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ img
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ js
â”œâ”€â”€ tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default_test.go
â””â”€â”€ views
    â””â”€â”€ index.tpl
```

As you can see, it's already pretty expressive. 

You can easily run a bee app using

```bash
bee run #inside the root directory ( i.e., test here )
```

# Session Caching 

Session caching is easy as 1, 2, 3 with beego.

```go
import (
    "github.com/beego/beego/v2/server/web/session"
)
var globalSessions *session.Manager
func init() {
    globalSessions, _ = session.NewManager("memory", `{"cookieName":"gosessionid", "enableSetCookie,omitempty": true, "gclifetime":3600, "maxLifetime": 3600, "secure": false, "sessionIDHashFunc": "sha1", "sessionIDHashKey": "", "cookieLifeTime": 3600, "providerConfig": ""}`)
    go globalSessions.GC()
}
```
With this you can easily use sessions in your web-app.

```go
func login(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    sess, _ := globalSessions.SessionStart(w, r)
    defer sess.SessionRelease(w)
    username := sess.Get("username")
    if r.Method == "GET" {
        t, _ := template.ParseFiles("login.gtpl")
        t.Execute(w, nil)
    } else {
        sess.Set("username", r.Form["username"])
    }
}
```

## Scaling session caching
Good question. You want to scale session caching from a memory db to a persistent database. 
Well that's pretty much a piece of cake with beego.
Check out all about it [here](https://beego.me/docs/module/session.md#saving-provider-config)

# i18n
So this is one of the more **highlighted** features of beego, providing an **i18n** module.
This actually helps making internationalized web apps easily.

Install the package using 
```bash
go get github.com/beego/i18n
```

The format of locale files is very much like the INI format configuration file, which is basically key-value pairs. But this module has some improvements. Every language corresponds to a locale file, for example, under `conf` directory, there are two files called `locale_en-US.ini` and `locale_zh-CN.ini`.

You can now, easily register locale files into your app

```go
langs := strings.Split(beego.AppConfig.String("lang::types"), "|")
names := strings.Split(beego.AppConfig.String("lang::names"), "|")
langTypes = make([]*langType, 0, len(langs))
for i, v := range langs {
    langTypes = append(langTypes, &langType{
        Lang: v,
        Name: names[i],
    })
}

for _, lang := range langs {
    beego.Trace("Loading language: " + lang)
    if err := i18n.SetMessage(lang, "conf/"+"locale_"+lang+".ini"); err != nil {
        beego.Error("Fail to set message file: " + err.Error())
        return
    }
}
```

You can easily set cookies, based on the locale chosen and then use it.

I would love to go about specifying how to internationalize your web app, in another blog!

# ORM
Yes, beego has it's own drivers for a variety of different databases, making it fast and efficient while developing incredible web applications.
I won't go about it this blog, but i'll surely make another blog specifically on the following topic.
You can check about the orm [here](https://beego.me/docs/mvc/model/orm.md#orm-usage) in the meantime.

# Important features of beego
Beego is similar to the Django website framework for Python. It offers a plethora of features that are common to the web application.

Apart from the general MVC elements, it moreover incorporates an ORM (Object-Relationship Map) to access session handling tools, data, an in-built cache handler, logging systems, and libraries for general operations with HTTP components.

Beego is familiar to Django in terms of CL (Command Line) Tools. A programmer can use bee command for developing Beego apps from the beginning or deal with the existing ones.
Beego,
-   Saves a lot of time
-   Faster web app development
-   Integrates ORM, built-in cache handler
-   No need for third party library


**Hope** you've understood how beego works, and why it's a good option if you're making an industry standard web application.
Till next time! ðŸ¦„
