# Go Generics!

Golang just released a beta version, offering a preview or atleast a working example of how to use generics and how it works with the compiler. 

```go
...

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func Writer[T string | int](w T) {
	fmt.Println(w)
}
func main() {
	Writer("Hello")
	Writer(1)
}
```
as simple as it looks, it's really unique and powerful. 
It has both the **easy** and **understandable** syntax that go already offers and more.
It works like any other language generics.

Lets assume this piece of code.

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func Writer[T string | int](w T) {
	fmt.Println(w)
}
func main() {
	Writer[int]("Hello")
	Writer(1)
}
```

This code, as you may have guessed **returns** an error.

```
 cannot use "Hello" (untyped string constant) as int value in argument to Writer[int]
 ```
 
 To fix it, either we'd have to change the generic type to "string" or change the param of the function to int type.
 
 ```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func Writer[T string | int](w T) {
	fmt.Println(w)
}
func main() {
	Writer[string]("Hello")
	Writer[int](1) 
}
```

# Notes

* Golang hasnt yet announced a **stable** version, therefore it is not adviced to use it in production.
* Due to addition of generics go 1.18-beta is roughly 15% slower check out more information about it [here](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/49569)

# Upgrading Version
Due to go 1.18 being unstable, golang has made the version a seperate executable.
You can download it [here](https://go.dev/dl)
and use
```bash
go1.18beta1 
```
in the cli to check out the help menu.

### OR

Install go1.18beta using the go cli (if you already have it installed)

```bash
go install golang.org/dl/go1.18beta1@latest
```
and then use 
```bash
go1.18beta1
```
instead of 
```bash
go
```
**Fyi, go does not update it just installs a seperate executable for testing out the beta version**

Well have fun looking at the new features, until next time ðŸ¤
